# Javascript-Canvas-Practice
Animations created with canvas.
//Canvas 1 is my first project made with canvas which involves particles floating across the screen randomly. As your mouse hovers over
//the canvas the particles will grow larger and then shrink back to their original size when the mouse is no longer within the required radius.
//This is also my first commit to github using the the command line.
